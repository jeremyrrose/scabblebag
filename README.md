# Scrabblebag

Scrabblebag is not Scrabble -- it's just the bag. Players can draw letters until the bag runs out.

Why is this useful? Because it makes remote play more accessible to people who don't want to (or *can't*) play a whole game on a phone, but who *do* wish they could play with loved ones far away. 

In conjunction with an old-fashioned telephone, this gizmo lets players share a pool of letters, while each plays with real tiles on a physical board wherever they are.

Call a friend you want to play with and **[visit Scrabblebag here](http://jeremy-rose.com/scrabblebag)**.
